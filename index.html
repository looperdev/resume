              I am an engineer/data scientist with a specialty in geographic
              information systems (GIS) and flood forecasting. My career has
              been focused on using new tech to solve traditional engineering
              problems. My PhD in engineering focused on using data science to
              improve operational flood forecasting. My passion has always been
              on using technology and I am wanting to broaden and deepen my
              skills in software development.

            requirements (FHWA and FEMA), designing temporary culverts for
            detour structures, engineering bridge abutments and rip-rap

             Responsible for assembly and analysis of geospatial data for setup
            and model configuration of ScourCast. This statewide system was
            designed for ODOT using software developed in
            <strong>JAVA</strong> to assist in the implementation of
            counter-measures for scour-critical bridges. When forecast
            streamflow exceeded bridge-specific frequency-based thresholds,
            notifications and web-based information were generated for
            engineering site review or bridge closure.  The system operated with
            input from 6 radars and 100+ rain gauges to provide forecast
            streamflow at more than 135 scour-critical bridges across the state.

            Co-instructor for the Dam Safety Hydrology training course focused

            characterization, developing the probable maximum storm hyetograph
            for a particular region, understanding appropriate applications for
            routing and transform methods, and using HEC-HMS computer modeling
            to demonstrate hydrological principles and analysis techniques.

            – The Norman SWMP identified $82.6 million in proposed storm water
            projects to be made over a 20 year program period. The SWMP included
            watershed and stream assessments, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling,
            and development of financial analyses for storm water funding
            sources. I created watershed specific GIS datasets for land use,
            hydrologic soil groups, floodplains, and impervious cover for the
            watershed assessments. I also participated in the stream corridor
            assessment field surveys.

              >Oklahoma Conservation Commission, Lake Thunderbird Watershed
              Analysis and Water Quality Evaluation, Norman, OK</strong
            >
            – The analysis determined the impacts of future development within
            the watershed on the lake’s water quality. The Soil and Water
            Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model was used to estimate
            nutrient loading into Lake Thunderbird. An in-lake model was then
            used to relate watershed nutrient loading to lake water quality.
            Next, best management practices (BMP) to reduce non-point source
            nutrient loading were recommended to meet in-lake water quality
            standards. Dr. Looper setup the SWAT model by converting GIS
            datasets (e.g. land use/cover, digital elevation models, and soil
            surveys) into model parameters (e.g. SCS curve numbers,
            imperviousness, and land surface slope). He also calibrated model
            parameters to accurately simulate the hydrology of the watershed.
